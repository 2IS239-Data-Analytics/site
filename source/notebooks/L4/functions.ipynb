    "You can think functions as little self-contained programs that can perform a specific task which you can use repeatedly in your code.\n",
    "One of the basic principles in good programming is \"do not to repeat yourself\".\n",
    "In other words, you should avoid having duplicate lines of code in your scripts.\n",
    "Functions are a good way to avoid such situations and they can save you a lot of time and effort as you don't need to tell the computer repeatedly what to do every time it does a common task, such as converting temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius.\n",
    "During the course we have already used some functions such as the `print()` command which is actually a built-in function in Python."
