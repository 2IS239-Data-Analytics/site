    "# Writing our scripts the \"right\" way\n",
    "\n",
    "The script above works, but one of the big advantages of using scripts is including features that make the code easier to read and understand. These include comments in the code, which explain what the code does, but are not executed when the code is run. As your programs get longer and more complicated, features such as comments will become essential. Below are some suggestions to make sure your code is formatted nicely and easy to understand.\n",
    "Inline comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Inline comments are comments within the code that explain what certain lines of the code do. To your, it may seem obvious how the code works, but if you share it with another person perhaps they will not feel the same way. It is a very good idea to make the code as easy to read as possible for people.\n",

    "# Station latitude and longitude - Latitude is north, longitude is east\n",
    "stationLat = 60.15\n",

    "\n",
    "Here, we have provided a a bit more information about the data in this script by adding inline comments. Inline comments begin with a # (number sign or hash), and all characters that follow on that line will be ignored by Python. Adding comments to scripts is essential for scientists like ourselves to both help us remember how a script works and to make it easier to share with colleagues. It is best to get into the habit of adding comments as you write.\n",
    "Use line breaks wisely\n",
    "\n",
    "Line breaks, or blank lines, in your scripts can greatly improve readability, and help divide different sections of the script. Perhaps it is obvious, but Python will ignore blank lines in a script.\n",

    "Use a docstring\n",
    "\n",
    "A docstring is a form of block comment at the start of your program that clearly states its purpose and how to run the program. A block comment is similar to the inline comments above, but starts with ''' and comments out all code between the start and another closing set of '''. You can also include your name, and possibly add licensing information in the docstring.\n",

    "Adding a license\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on what you aim to do with your script, you may want to include a formal software license in the docstring to state the conditions under which the code can be used or modified. There are many helpful web resources to teach you about software licenses and how to choose a license. In most cases my preference is the MIT License, which is simple and allows software use by anyone. An example is below.\n",

Well, without going into too much detail, it makes it easier for users to run your script directly from a terminal, rather than needing to use Spyder or open an IPython console first.
