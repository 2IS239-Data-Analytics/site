Lesson overview
===============

In this lesson we will continue to develop our data analysis skills using `Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`__ and also learn a bit about debugging our scripts and interpreting errors.

This year we're teaching these concepts using your choice of two different Python module options: **Pandas** and **NumPy**.
`Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`__ is a modern and feature rich data analysis framework for Python that is designed
to make data analysis and manipulation straightforward and powerful using easy-to-use data structures and operations.
`NumPy <https://www.numpy.org/>`__ is designed for efficient numerical computing in Python.

We recommend that students continuing on to the **Automating GIS processes** course follow the lessons using **Pandas** below.

1. :doc:`Pandas lesson <pandas>`
2. :doc:`Exercise 6: Data analysis II <exercise-6>`

Those continuing on in the **Introduction to Quantitative Geology** course should follow the **NumPy** lessons.

1. :doc:`NumPy lesson <numpy>`
2. :doc:`Exercise 6: Data analysis II <exercise-6>`


In the second half of the lesson we will focus on debugging.
Many new programmers struggle with removing problems in their code (debugging) because they start randomly making changes without a clear picture of what is wrong or even what the code should do!
By learning a few basic ideas about debugging and interpreting error messages, we hope to save you time and frustration as your scripts become more complex.

1. :doc:`Interpreting error messages <interpreting-errors>`
2. :doc:`Debugging your scripts <debugging-scripts>`
3. :doc:`Exercise 6 <ex-6>`
4. :doc:`Hints for Exercise 6 <exercise-6-hints>`

Learning goals
--------------

After this weeks lesson your should be able to:

- Analyze data in Python using different functions of Pandas
- Understand common Python errors
- Follow a simple set of guidelines to debug programs efficiently
