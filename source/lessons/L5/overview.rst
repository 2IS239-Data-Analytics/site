Lesson overview
===============

In this lesson we will learn basics in reading and writing data from/to a file, and do some basic data manipulation
and analysis using a Python module called **Pandas**.
`Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`__ is a modern and feature rich data analysis framework for Python that is designed
to make data analysis and manipulation straightforward and powerful using easy-to-use data structures and operations.
