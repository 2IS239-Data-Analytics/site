What is Pandas?
===============

`Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`__ is a modern, powerful and feature rich library that is designed for doing
data analysis in Python. It is a mature data analytics framework that is widely used among different fields of science,
thus there exists a lot of good examples and documentation that can help you get going with your data analysis tasks.
In Pandas the data is typically stored into a DataFrame that looks like a typical table with rows and columns
(+ indices and column names), where columns can contain data of different data types.
Thus, it reminds a little bit of how data is stored e.g. in Excel or in R that also uses a concept of a dataframe.

Pandas takes advantage of `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`__ -module which runs under the hood and is mostly written in C,
which makes it fast and powerful library that can handle efficiently even large datasets.
Pandas offers easier and more intuitive syntax to do data analysis and manipulation using either `numpy`
functionalities in the background or dedicated functionalities written explicitly for Pandas.
However, Pandas is much more than easier-to-use `numpy` as it also combines many functionalities from other Python
libraries such as `matplotlib (plotting) <https://matplotlib.org/>`__ and
`scipy (mathematics, science, engineering) <https://www.scipy.org/>`__. Thus, you can use many of the features
included in those packages even without importing them at all.
