Launching a new computer instance
=================================

Launching a new computer instance is a straightforward procedure that is
done from the Computing Dashboard. These instructions will help you
first launch a new Computer Instance and then open a port to it from
your local computer's IP address (steps 5-6). A port in a computer is a
somewhat similar to the idea of having a door in a house: you cannot
access the house without having an open door. In this analogy, the
default computing instance will have all the doors closed until you open
one for yourself.

1. Navigate with a web browser to https://pb.geo.helsinki.fi.

      going to this address often.

2. Sign in to the Computing Dashboard

   Login to Computing Dashboard

3. ``Launch new`` computer instance

4. Wait until the instance is ready. You will first see a spinning gear
   under the **State**, the instance is ready when the gear turns into a
   checkmark. Now go to instance details by clicking on it's name (here
   the name is ``pb-donna-the-blue``, but it changes every time).
